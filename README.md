# Miscellaneous

Some random pieces of code that I would need for some particular task.

continued_fractiona is a couple of functions that use Euclid's algorithm to display an improper fraction as a continued one. For produce_cont(a,b) the last digit is GCD(a,b). This is also known as Euler's method of finding GCD.
