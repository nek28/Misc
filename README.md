# Miscellaneous

Some random pieces of code that I would need for some particular task.

continued_fractions is a couple of functions that use Euclid's algorithm to display an improper fraction as a continued one. For a fun output, I suggest using it on some relatively big successive Fibonacci numbers (or, in general, Lucas numbers) like 121393 and 75025.
